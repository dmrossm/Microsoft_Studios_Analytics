# Microsoft Studios Analytics

## Overview

## Business Problem:

Microsoft intends to add a movie studio division to its business portfolio. In doing so it needs insights into how it can maximize profit and minimize cost within this new division of its rather large company.

## Data:
My data was derived from https://www.imdb.com (IMDB = Internet Movie Database) and https://www.the-numbers.com and consisted of two csv's based on data from those websites.

## Methods:
I used descriptive statistics from 4 features from these dataframes. One feature consisted of Return on Investment, which I calculated as ROI = ((gross profit - production cost)/production cost) x 100).
These descriptive statistics led me choose to me compare ROI to release month, runtime and genre (of films).
